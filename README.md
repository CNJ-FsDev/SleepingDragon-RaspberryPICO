Welcome! I am going to build a "Sleeping Dragoon" - Working with Raspberry PICO.
Through the GP port of the Pico, the 5 LED lights are controlled to light up in turn, and then turn off
in turn to form a Colorful flowing light.

<b>Hardware:</b>
  - 1x Raspberry Pi PICO 
  - 1x SunFounder Breadboard Power Bank (Power Supply Module)
  - 2x Medium Breadboard
  - 5x LED
  - 1x Dupont Line
  - 10x Male-Male short line

<h3><b>What us Sleeping dragon and how does it work?</b></h3>
1.Breadboard:
<p>Breadboard is designed and manufactured for solderless experimentation of electronic circuits. Since there are many small jacks on the board, various electronic components can be inserted or pulled
out at will, eliminating the need for soldering and saving the assembly time of the circuit, and the
components can be reused, so it is very suitable for the assembly and debugging of electronic circuits.</p>
2.Light emitting diode:
<p>Light emitting diode(short name:LED), is solid-state semiconductor devices that convert electricity
into visible light. The core part of LED is a chip composed of P-type semiconductor and N-type
semiconductor. When the current passes through the chip, the electrons in the N-type semiconductor and
the holes in the P-type semiconductor collide and compound in the luminous layer to produce photons, and emit energy in the form of photons, namely visible light. Its long pin is positive, short pin is negative,
the current is unidirectional from positive to negative.</p>
